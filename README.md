## My process

First got the right approach to come up with this , added necessary files and folders,
started with the HTML5 code which is the structure of a site.
Styled with a CSS style sheet.
initialized on git and pushed this codes to github using the command prompt.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learnt hoe to use ionicon as an alternative to fontawesome because of some problems encountered.
Secondly, I got another understanding of css flexbox.



### Continued development

I wish to have an understanding of making a responsive site whether static or dynamic.
Flex containers and margin manipulations.


### Useful resources

- [ionicons](https://ionicons.com) - This helped me to add the soial media icons.
  I really like it and will make use of it in future projects.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - This is an amazingdite which helped me add the required font in my project.
  I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
